Example code on how to use:
```
>>> from number_game import Game
>>> game = Game() # default bounds (0-100)
>>> game.make_guess(10)
'Your guess is lower than the mystical number :('
>>> game.make_guess(90)
'Your guess is higher than the mystical number :('
>>> game.make_guess(82)
'You found it in 2 attempts!'
```
If you wish to specify lower and upper bounds for the game, you could initialize the game as follows:
